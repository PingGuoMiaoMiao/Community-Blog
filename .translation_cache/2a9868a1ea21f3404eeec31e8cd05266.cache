- [CGaaaaaa](https://github.com/CGaaaaaa) developed [moonbit-url](https://github.com/CGaaaaaa/moonbit-url), an RFC 3986-compliant URI parsing and manipulation library for MoonBit. It provides full URI parsing, normalization, reference resolution, and percent-encoding capabilities, with support for IPv6 addresses, file operations, and query parameter management. Documentation for individual APIs is currently incomplete.  
- [GreatHank](https://github.com/GreatHank) developed [regression-tools](https://github.com/GreatHank/regression-tools), a regression toolkit for MoonBit. The library offers multiple regression analysis algorithms, including machine learning models such as logistic regression. This toolkit is primarily used for data analysis and predictive modeling, helping developers build and train regression models for numerical prediction and classification tasks. The project is currently in its early stage of development.
