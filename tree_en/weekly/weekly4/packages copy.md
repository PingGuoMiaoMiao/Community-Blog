title: New High-Quality Community Packages This Week

- [kesmeey](https://github.com/kesmeey) developed the [immut_BitVector](https://github.com/moonbit-community/immut_BitVector) library for compact and efficient storage and manipulation of boolean sequences. It provides a series of bitwise operations while maintaining immutability, where all modification operations return new instances.  
- MoonBit official contributor [NSlash951 myfreess](https://github.com/myfreess) created a Unicode CaseFold library for MoonBit: [casefold](https://github.com/myfreess/casefold), enabling fuzzy matching for Unicode.  
- [xunyoyo](https://github.com/xunyoyo) implemented an ML-KEM algorithm library for MoonBit: [moonkem](https://github.com/moonbit-community/moonkem), currently in early development.  
- [Milky2018](https://github.com/Milky2018) built a command-line argument parsing library [options](https://github.com/Milky2018/options). This JSON-based library supports flexible CLI argument parsing and is currently experimental.  
- [蓝莓小果冻 Bemly](https://github.com/Bemly) authored [mbt-cstdio-ffi](https://github.com/Bemly/mbt-cstdio-ffi), a MoonBit FFI binding for C standard library I/O. It connects C's stdio interfaces with MoonBit via FFI, strictly adheres to C's resource management rules (no garbage collection), and requires manual release of all file streams—ideal for low-level I/O control scenarios.
